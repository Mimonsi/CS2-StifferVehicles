# [Stiffer Vehicles](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/81012/Windows)
This mod adds settings to increase the stiffness of vehicles. Higher values mean less bouncy behaviour and leaning into curves. The default value of 3.0 already provides higher realism. 

Feel free to change the value to whatever value you personally prefer.
