# [Stiffer Vehicles](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/81012/Windows)
This mod adds settings to increase the stiffness of vehicles. Higher values mean less bouncy behaviour and leaning into curves. The default values of 1.75 already provide higher realism. 

Feel free to change the values to whatever value you personally prefer.
